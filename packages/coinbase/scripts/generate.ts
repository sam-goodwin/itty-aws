/**
 * generate — turn the Smithy JSON model in .generated-specs into the
 * Coinbase CDP Effect SDK.
 *
 * Input:  .generated-specs/cdp.json  (written by scripts/convert.ts)
 * Output: src/services/cdp.ts  +  src/services/index.ts
 *
 * The smithy→SDK compiler and CLI pipeline live in
 * `@distilled.cloud/core/codegen`; this script is Coinbase's provider spec.
 * The CDP API is bearer-REST with camelCase wire names (identity member
 * naming, v0 parity), no response envelope, and no per-op error lists —
 * errors are matched globally in src/protocol.ts. Mirroring distilled v0,
 * no paginated op variants are emitted: the CDP pageToken/nextPageToken ops
 * stay plain operations and callers loop manually.
