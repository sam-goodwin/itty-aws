/**
 * Remove One Organization
 *
 * Removes one specified organization. MongoDB Cloud imposes the following limits on this resource:
 * - Organizations with active projects cannot be removed.
 * - All projects in the organization must be removed before you can remove the organization.
 * To use this resource, the requesting Service Account or API Key must have the Organization Owner role.
 *
 * @param envelope - Flag that indicates whether Application wraps the response in an `envelope` JSON object. Some API clients cannot access the HTTP response headers or status code. To remediate this, set envelope=true in the query. Endpoints that return a list of results use the results object as an envelope. Application adds the status parameter to the response body.
 * @param orgId - Unique 24-hexadecimal digit string that identifies the organization that contains your projects. Use the [`/orgs`](#tag/Organizations/operation/listOrganizations) endpoint to retrieve all organizations to which the authenticated user has access.
