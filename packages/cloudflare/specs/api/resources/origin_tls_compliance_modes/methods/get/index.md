## Get Origin TLS Compliance Modes setting

**get** `/zones/{zone_id}/settings/origin_tls_compliance_modes`

Origin TLS Compliance Modes constrains the set of TLS key-exchange algorithms Cloudflare may use when establishing the TLS connection to the zone's origin. The value is a list of named compliance modes (currently `fips` and `pqh`). Multiple modes are combined as the intersection of their permitted algorithm lists. An empty list (or no rule configured) means no compliance constraint is applied.

### Path Parameters

- `zone_id: string`

  Identifier.

### Returns

- `errors: array of ResponseInfo`

  - `code: number`

  - `message: string`

  - `documentation_url: optional string`

  - `source: optional object { pointer }`

    - `pointer: optional string`

- `messages: array of ResponseInfo`

  - `code: number`

  - `message: string`

  - `documentation_url: optional string`

  - `source: optional object { pointer }`

- `success: true`

  Whether the API call was successful.

  - `true`

- `result: optional object { id, editable, value, modified_on }`

  - `id: "origin_tls_compliance_modes"`

    The identifier of the caching setting.

    - `"origin_tls_compliance_modes"`

  - `editable: boolean`

    Whether the setting is editable.

  - `value: array of string`

    List of TLS compliance modes that constrain the key-exchange algorithms Cloudflare may use when establishing the TLS connection to the zone's origin. Currently supported values are `fips` (FIPS-approved curves) and `pqh` (post-quantum hybrid). Future modes (e.g. `cnsa2`) may be added; clients should treat unknown values as opaque strings. Multiple modes are combined as the intersection of their permitted algorithm lists; selections whose intersection is empty are rejected. An empty list clears the constraint.

  - `modified_on: optional string`

    Last time this setting was modified.
