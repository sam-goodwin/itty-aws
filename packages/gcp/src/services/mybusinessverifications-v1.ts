This is often the UI language of the input form or is expected to match one of the languages used in the address' country/region, or their transliterated equivalents. This can affect formatting in certain countries, but is not critical to the correctness of the data and will never affect any validation or other non-formatting related operations. If this value is not known, it should be omitted (rather than specifying a possibly incorrect default). Examples: "zh-Hant", "ja", "ja-Latn", "en". */
  languageCode?: string;
  /** Optional. Highest administrative subdivision which is used for postal addresses of a country or region. For example, this can be a state, a province, an oblast, or a prefecture. For Spain, this is the province and not the autonomous community (for example, "Barcelona" and not "Catalonia"). Many countries don't use an administrative area in postal addresses. For example, in Switzerland, this should be left unpopulated. */

  locality?: string;
  /** Optional. Additional, country-specific, sorting code. This is not used in most regions. Where it is used, the value is either a string like "CEDEX", optionally followed by a number (for example, "CEDEX 7"), or just a number alone, representing the "sector code" (Jamaica), "delivery area indicator" (Malawi) or "post office indicator" (Côte d'Ivoire). */

  /** Unstructured address lines describing the lower levels of an address. Because values in `address_lines` do not have type information and may sometimes contain multiple values in a single field (for example, "Austin, TX"), it is important that the line order is clear. The order of address lines should be "envelope order" for the country or region of the address. In places where this can vary (for example, Japan), `address_language` is used to make it explicit (for example, "ja" for large-to-small ordering and "ja-Latn" or "en" for small-to-large). In this way, the most specific line of an address can be selected based on the language. The minimum permitted structural representation of an address consists of a `region_code` with all remaining information placed in the `address_lines`. It would be possible to format such an address very approximately without geocoding, but no semantic reasoning could be made about any of the address components until it was at least partially resolved. Creating an address only containing a `region_code` and `address_lines` and then geocoding is the recommended way to handle completely unstructured addresses (as opposed to guessing which parts of the address should be localities or administrative areas). */
