# Duplicate an Ad Group

> Creates copies of the ad group in `duplicating` status and returns them — into its own campaign, or into target_ad_campaign_id (which must belong to the same account and be compatible with the ad group's targeting and goals); each copy transitions to its final status (matching the source's active/paused state) once duplication completes. Poll each returned ad group until it leaves `duplicating` — a copy that could not be completed is deleted and returns 404.
