# Replay Delivery

> Re-sends the exact payload of a past delivery to the webhook's current URL and returns the delivery result. By default the replay keeps the original `webhook-id`, so consumers that deduplicate on it can drop events they already processed. Pass `regenerate_id` to re-send under a freshly generated `webhook-id` instead, so a deduplicating consumer processes the replay as a new message. Only available for enabled webhooks on API version v1; deliveries are retained for 30 days.
