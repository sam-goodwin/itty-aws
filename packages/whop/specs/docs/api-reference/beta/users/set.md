# Set

> Sets the authenticated user's notification preferences. Each preference is addressed by `scope`, not by id, so a scope read back from either list endpoint can be sent straight here.

A scope naming an experience with no topic sets that experience's level, and accepts all three levels. Any other scope sets a topic override, which is binary — `all` or `nothing` — and requires a `channel`.

`level: null` clears the preference. Preferences are stored as overrides, so clearing one means the scope inherits its default again rather than being switched off.

The batch is applied in one transaction: if any entry is rejected, none are written. Experience levels are applied before topic overrides, because setting a level replaces every topic preference for that experience — so an override sent alongside a level wins. The response reports what each scope now resolves to, in the order the entries were sent.
