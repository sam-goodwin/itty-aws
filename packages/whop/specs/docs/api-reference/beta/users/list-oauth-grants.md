# List OAuth Grants

> Lists the authenticated user's own OAuth grants — one per app they have authorized, per account they authorized it for. The list is always the caller's own; there is no parameter for reading another user's grants. Requires a user session: an API key or an OAuth token is refused, so an app can never enumerate the other apps a user has authorized.
