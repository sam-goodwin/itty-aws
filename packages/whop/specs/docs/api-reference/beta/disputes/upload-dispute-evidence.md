# Upload Dispute Evidence

> Replaces the full set of uploaded evidence documents on a dispute, beyond the four fixed evidence slots. Upload files through `POST /files` and reference them by `id`, or send the files as multipart file parts to upload and attach in one call. Send every document the packet should carry — up to 10, 10MB each and 25MB in total; an empty list removes them all. Accepted content types: application/pdf, application/json, image/jpeg, image/png, image/webp — any other type is rejected.
