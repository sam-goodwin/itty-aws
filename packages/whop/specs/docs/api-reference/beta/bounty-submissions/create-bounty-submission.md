# Create Bounty Submission

> Creates a submission on a workforce bounty. Include a `deliverable` payload — any combination of links and uploaded files, with at least one of the two — and the submission goes straight to review; create is the only step. For `data_capture` bounties, omit the deliverable: this starts a claimed attempt whose proof accumulates server-side, and the separate submit endpoint sends it to review once complete. Requires a user credential — account API keys cannot author submissions.
