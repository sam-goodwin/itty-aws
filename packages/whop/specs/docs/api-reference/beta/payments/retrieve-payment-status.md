# Retrieve payment status

> Retrieves how far a payment has got and what the buyer must do next, if anything. A payment is collected in the background, so poll this rather than reading the create response. Accepts either a secret key or the payment's own `client_secret`, so the surface collecting the payment can poll it directly.
