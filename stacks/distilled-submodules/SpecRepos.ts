/**
 * The spec mirrors: one `distilled-mirror/spec-mirror-<package>` repository
 * per `packages/*` directory that consumes an API spec.
 *
 * Each mirror holds the spec files the package's generator reads and the
 * machinery to refresh them daily — and nothing else. That is the whole point:
 * several upstreams (github/rest-api-description at ~6.7 GB checked out,
 * kubernetes/kubernetes at ~1.5 GB, Azure/azure-rest-api-specs at tens of GB)
 * are submoduled today for a handful of files, and `specs:sync` at the repo
 * root materialises every one of them in full. A mirror replaces the submodule
 * with the subset, so cloning this monorepo stops being a multi-gigabyte
 * operation.
 *
 * The per-repository fetch script lives in `spec-repos/<package>/`. Each one is
 * written against ITS upstream — a raw file download, a sparse partial clone, a
 * REST endpoint, a GraphQL introspection — because the upstreams have nothing
 * in common. The shared scaffolding (workflow, tsconfig, gitignore) is in
 * `scaffold/`.
