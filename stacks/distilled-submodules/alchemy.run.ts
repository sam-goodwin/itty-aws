/**
 * One spec-mirror repository per spec-consuming SDK package.
 *
 * Every `packages/*` directory that has a `specs/` folder gets a
 * `spec-mirror-<name>` repository in the `distilled-mirror` org, holding the
 * spec files that package's generator reads plus a workflow that refreshes
 * them every 24 hours — and nothing else.
 *
 * That "nothing else" is the point. Several upstream spec repositories are
 * submoduled today for a handful of files: github/rest-api-description is
 * ~6.7 GB checked out for one 13 MB document, kubernetes/kubernetes ~1.5 GB
 * for one 4 MB document, Azure/azure-rest-api-specs 338,000+ files for about
 * 780. `specs:sync` at the repo root materialises every one of them in full.
 * A mirror holds the subset instead, so submoduling it costs what the specs
 * cost.
 *
 * The stack owns two things per repository:
 *
 *   - the repository itself (`GitHub.Repository`), which converges against
 *     the live repository — existing repositories are adopted and their
 *     settings synced, never duplicated. The default removal policy is
 *     `retain`, so nothing here can delete a repository.
 *   - its file set (`SyncScaffold`, an Alchemy Action), which commits the
 *     scaffold and deletes anything else that appears under a managed prefix.
 *
 * State lives in the remote Cloudflare state store (the same one the alchemy
 * monorepo uses), so every deploy — local or CI — converges the same stack.
